# Horiseon Code Refactor

Marketing Agecy wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards for the site to be optimized for search engines. Only requested changes for "desktop" layout.

The following source code adjustments have been made:

- Added accessible alt attributes.
- Replaced div soup with proper HTML semantics.
- CSS properties now follow a logical structure of styling and positioning.
- Title Element now has a concise, descriptive title.
